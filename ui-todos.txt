Homeworks:
- Remove App1.js
- Add simple Header, footer - improve.
- Move the URL to a constants file - use proper naming conventions.
- Async (SkillShare, YT)
- Learn how to hit the API periodically(every 1s - time should come from the constants file as well) - use
    promise to fix the setTimeout code.

<Discussion> - fix API contract.

- Learn about Linked List.
- Create a linked list (write tests as well) and use it instead of a list for log lines state.
- Add a limit to the number of logs displayed (100 - again, from constants).
